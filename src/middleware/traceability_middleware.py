"""
Also known as a Transit ID, is a unique identifier value that is attached to requests
and messages that allow reference to a particular transaction or event chain.

For Correlation ID, in general, you donâ€™t have to use one. But if you are designing a
distributed system that incorporates message queues and asynchronous processing, you will
do well to include a Correlation ID in your messages.

Within HTTP headers, this is usually set as `x-correlation-id`.
